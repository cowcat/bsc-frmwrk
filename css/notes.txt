use legend & fieldset for filter and sort elements?
navs and sorts should work the same? 
keep anchors the same as now.


action items:
	Figure out sign in. Need to add forgot password link. How does this play with the "Sign up" anchor? Should it be an anchor?
	Implement an image for Main Content on Mobile. Might be able to sell that instead of content slider?


let's make links behave the same, regardless of context	
<a href="somewheregreat.html" class="button"></a>
<a href="somewheregreat.html" class="bubble navigation || sort"></a>
